📘 Basic C++ Programming Exercises

This repository contains beginner-friendly C++ programs covering input/output, operators, ASCII, arithmetic, and type casting.
Each question strengthens logic-building and C++ fundamentals.

📝 Section-A (Basics)
1. Write a C++ program to input two integers and print their:

Sum

Difference

Product

Quotient (integer division)

2. Program to input integer x and display:

++x

x++

Final value of x

3. Program to input integers a and b and print:

a % b

b % a

4. Program to input a character and print its ASCII value.
5. Program to input an ASCII integer value and print the corresponding character.
6. Program to input two numbers and print remainder of a % b.
7. Program to input integer x and print:

x + 5

x - 3

x * 2

x / 2

x % 2

8. Program to input a double value and print its integer part using type casting.
9. Program to input a double value and print only its decimal part.
10. Program to input a character and print the next character using pre-increment (++c).
11. Program to input a character and print the previous character using decrement operator (--c).
12. Program to input an integer and show:

Value before post-increment (x++)

Value after post-increment

Value after pre-increment (++x)

13. Program to input two integers, convert to double, and print floating-point division.
14. Program to input a character digit (e.g., '5') and convert it into integer using c - '0'.
15. Program to input two float numbers and print:

Sum

Difference

Product

Division

16. Program to input two numbers and compute

(a + b) * (a - b)

17. Program to input integers a and b and print:

(a * b) % 10

(a + b) % 5

18. Program to input an integer and print its ASCII character using char(x)
19. Program to input a float and print its rounded-down value using type casting.
20. Program to input integers a, b, c and compute the expression:

a + b * c - (++b)

🧮 Section-B (Level: Hard)
1. Program to input a 3-digit number and print the sum of its digits.
2. Program to input a 2-digit number and print the reversed number.
3. Program to input age in years and convert to days

(Assume 1 year = 365 days)

4. Program to input total minutes and convert to hours and minutes.
5. Program to input seconds and convert into hours, minutes, and remaining seconds.
